# acceptableads
Allows ads without whitelisting tracking images/scripts

The original "Acceptable Ads" was made with just ad blocking users in mind. I hope to make a privacy respecting filter list which allows some ads, but doesn't allow trackers like the original Acceptable Ads does.

I will only focus on making exception filters for EasyList and the uBlock - Ads list. AdGuard filters will likely be ignored.
